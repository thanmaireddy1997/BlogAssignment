          <p style="color: rgb(97, 64, 14);font-size: 24px;text-align: justify;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-style: cursive;">There is a lot of scientific evidence to prove that art enhances the functioning of the brain. Art, directly and indirectly, affects brain wave patterns, nervous systems, emotions, and also raises serotonin levels. It can easily change the way people experience the world and even change their outlook. 
            Years of research now provide enough information proving that art education can impact almost all parts of human life, from their academic performance/achievement to their emotional and social development. We also know now that art helps develop the neural systems responsible for producing a broad spectrum of benefits that range from creativity to fine motor skills, better emotional balance, and much more. In one sentence, art is essential to the proper functioning both individually and collectively as a society.

          <p style="color: rgb(97, 64, 14);font-size: 24px;text-align: justify;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-style: cursive;">
            As Jacob Devaney rightly puts it in one of his articles, when a person observes a piece of art, they are potentially working the same neurons performed in the artist while they were creating the art. This creates new neural pathways in the beholder and also stimulates a sense of inspiration in them. The feeling of being drawn to artwork or painting is known as embodied cognition.

          <p style="color: rgb(97, 64, 14);font-size: 24px;text-align: justify;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-style: cursive;">
            In one of the numerous experiments carried out to understand the impact of art on the brain, Professor Semir Zeki, University College London, he tried to understand the brain's activities or what's happening in the mind when we view beautiful paintings.
            According to the experiment, when we look at artwork – be it still life, landscape, a portrait of an abstract – there are powerful activities in the brain that deal with pleasure. During the experiments, the participants were made to undergo brain scans while looking at a series of paintings drawn by significant artists. When the participants look at arts that they thought were very beautiful, the flow of blood in some parts of the brain increased by up to 10%, and this is equal to the same reaction when looking at one's lover. The paintings that produced the most pleasure response were those from artists such as Ingres, Claude Monet, and Constable.
